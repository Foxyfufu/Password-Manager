            <h3>What is <span class="text-warning"> Social Engineering Attack? </span></h3>
            <p class="lead">
              Cyber security social engineering attack is the act of executing malicious 
              activities accomplished through human interactions. It often preys on human 
              emotions such as greed, curiosity or anxiety to successfully trick people 
              to make security mistakes. Recently, social engineering attacks are 
              prevailing, and more people fall prey into these meticulously laid traps.

                <p class="card-text">
                  Scareware is a tactic that manipulates victims into believing that they need to 
                  download or buy a software. Most often initiated by bombarding victims with false alarms
                  and fictitious threats to make them think that their systems are infected with malware. 
                  Scareware goals can vary from selling these fake software or installing the actual damaging 
                  malware to steal private information.

              <p class="card-text">
                Phishing uses a disguised e-mail to trick the recipient into believing it 
                came from a legitimate source. The sender e-mail is often masked with an address that 
                looks real and contains attachments to malware or links to malicious sites. When 
                the victim clicks on the link or attachment, malware will be installed or malicious website 
                that looks legitimate asking for confidential information will open.

              <p class="card-text">
                Pretexting is typically phase one of a broader scheme to extract information from a victim. It 
                usually involves the attacker creating a good pretext (fabricated scenario) and impersonating a 
                trusted individual or a person who is credible such as police offers or banks. They pretend to 
                need sensitive information urgently for a critical task and give the victim no time to think.

          <h3><span class="text-success">How to avoid falling victim?</span></h3>
          <p>
            1. Verify sender identity <br>
            Although most phishing e-mails may appear real in the first glance, many loopholes can be 
            seen after taking closer looks. Phishing e-mails can be masked with real extensions to impersonate colleagues or 
            government officials. However, clicking into the e-mail will show the actual sender e-mail address which 
            is usually a dummy address with random characters. Other ways to identify can also include a generic 
            greeting or unofficial e-mail template.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. Multi factor verification <br>
            Multi factor verification is a security technology that requires multiple forms of methods to authenticate 
            the userâ€™s identity for a login or transaction. The forms of identification are usually from these three 
            key factors: Knowledge (password), Possession (token) and Inherence (facial recognition). Hence, users should 
            always set up multi factor verification as attackers are unable to access the information 
            even if they know the password since other methods of verification are required.
